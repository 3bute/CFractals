Enjoy patterns of nature! The viewer provides minimalistic design, intuitive functionality and easy to use interface.

- Zoom and move the image
- Go to previous step
- Finest color control
- Save the image from canvas
- Update the image after window rescaling

- Full control over significant parameters such resolution, iterations, magnification, color, number of threads etc.
- Multithreaded environment
- Switch from normal to arbitrary precision. Due to the calculation overhead the arbitrary precision is much slower. For faster interactions, use normal instead.
